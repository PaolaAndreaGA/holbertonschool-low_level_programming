# Search algorithm

In  [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a  **search algorithm**  is an  [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm")  (typically involving a multitude of other, more specific algorithms  [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm#cite_note-1)) which solves a  [search problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_problem "Search problem"). Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within some  [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure"), or calculated in the  [search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region "Feasible region")  of a problem domain, with  [either discrete or continuous values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable "Continuous or discrete variable").

While the search problems described above and  [web search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search "Web search")  are both problems in information retrieval, they are generally studied as separate subfields and are solved and evaluated differently. Web search problems are generally focused on filtering and finding documents that are most relevant to human queries. Classic search algorithms are typically evaluated on how fast they can find a solution, and whether that solution is guaranteed to be optimal. Though information retrieval algorithms must be fast, the quality of  [ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_(information_retrieval) "Ranking (information retrieval)"), and whether good results have been left out and bad results included, is more important.

The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as  [search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree "Search tree"),  [hash maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_map "Hash map"), and  [database indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index "Database index").

Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing.  [Linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search "Linear search")  algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKnuth1998%C2%A76.1_(%22Sequential_Searching%22)-4)  [Binary, or half-interval, searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm "Binary search algorithm")  repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKnuth1998%C2%A76.2_(%22Searching_by_Comparison_of_Keys%22)-5)  Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKnuth1998%C2%A76.3_(Digital_Searching)-6)  Finally,  [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table "Hash table")  directly maps keys to records based on a  [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash function").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKnuth1998%C2%A76.4,_(Hashing)-7)

Algorithms are often evaluated by their  [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity "Computational complexity"), or maximum theoretical run time. Binary search functions, for example, have a maximum complexity of  _O_(log  _n_), or logarithmic time. This means that the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space.
